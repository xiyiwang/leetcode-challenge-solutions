# LeetCode Challenge: Path With Minimum Effort ï¼ˆ01/26/2021)

#   You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, 
#   a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents 
#   the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, 
#   (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) 
#   (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to 
#   find a route that requires the minimum effort. 
#
#   A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between 
#   two consecutive cells of the route. 
# 
#   Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to 
#   the bottom-right cell. 
#
#   Constraints: 
#   * rows == heights.length 
#   * columns == heights[i].length
#   * 1 <= rows, columns <= 100 
#   * 1 <= heights[i][j] <= 10^6
