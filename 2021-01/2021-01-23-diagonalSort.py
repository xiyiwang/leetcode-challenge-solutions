# LeetCode Challenge: Sort the Matrix Diagonally ï¼ˆ01/23/2021)

#   A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some 
#   cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the 
#   bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end. 
#   For example, the matrix diagonal starting from mat[2][0], where mat 
#   is a 6 x 3 matrix, includes cells mat[2][0], mat[3][1], and mat[4][2].
# 
#   Given an m x n matrix mat of integers, sort each matrix diagonal in 
#   ascending order and return the resulting matrix.
#
#   Constraints:
#   * m == mat.length
#   * n == mat[i].length
#   * 1 <= m, n <= 100
#   * 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100
