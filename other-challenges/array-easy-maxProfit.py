# array: easy - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

#   Say you have an array prices for which the ith 
#   element is the price of a given stock on day i. 
# 
#   Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. 
#   You may complete as many transactions as you like 
#   (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock 
#   multiple times). 
# 
#   Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions 
#   at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock 
#   before you buy again). 
# 
#   Constraints:
#   * 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4 
#   * 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

def maxProfit(prices):
    pass

prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] # 7
# prices = [1,2,3,4,5] # 4
# prices = [7,6,4,3,1] # 0

print(maxProfit(prices))
